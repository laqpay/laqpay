laqpay
=======


The laqpay client binary uses a localhost http interface for its GUI.
By default it runs on http://127.0.0.1:12176.  This is configurable with

    --web-interface-port
    --web-interface-addr

To see a list of all options, use the -h flag.

The laqpay.run script starts the laqpay client binary and opens the interface
in your browser with xdg-open.  It is not aware of any changes to laqpay client's
web interface configuration, you can override the url with LAQPAY_WEB_URL or
by editing the laqpay.url file.

If there is no webpage available, try reloading the page. The page may have opened
before the laqpay client finished loading.
